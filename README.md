Vulpine
======

> This package allows you to use WHMCS data using Eloquent, with any PHP project or even framework.

Vulpine is a class collection created to retrieve WHMCS database data using a better syntax. It uses the [Eloquent ORM](https://github.com/illuminate/database) developed for the Laravel Framework, but you can use Vulpine in any type of PHP project, with any framework, including Laravel.

This way, you can use WHMCS data to display on your hosting website such as pricing tables, package info, domain pricing. You can use whatever you want in the frontend such as Slim Framework, Laravel, Zend or even pure PHP.

## Installation

To install Vulpine, just run the following command:

```
composer require goodbytes/vulpine
```
